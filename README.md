## Overview

This challenge was a bit difficult for me because to achieve it, I had to avoid using the default <ul> and <ol> tags, which I had never done before.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I understood the importance of breaking down the design into small, reusable code blocks to make the work easier.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.content-block {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 24px;
  margin-bottom: 32px;
}
```
